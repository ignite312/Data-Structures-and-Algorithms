## Setting up Sublime Text

This repository contains implementations of some basic data structures and algorithms, code templates, and snippets useful for competitive programming.

### Install the editor settings and snippets
1. Locate the `user` folder inside the `Sublime Setup` directory of this repository.
2. Back up your current Sublime `Packages/User` folder (recommended).
3. Copy the `user` folder from this repo into Sublime Text's `Packages` directory for your platform:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Sublime Text 3\\Packages\\`
- Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/`

4. Restart Sublime Text to apply the new settings and snippets.

Notes:
- These instructions target Sublime Text 3. If you use Sublime Text 4 (Sublime Text), paths may differ—adjust accordingly.
- If you prefer merging rather than replacing, copy individual files from the `user` folder into your existing `Packages/User`.
